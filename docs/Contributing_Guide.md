## 1. Finding an issue to work on

Building Open Source projects is a collaborative process. Features and bug requests are discussed with maintainers and users to find the best solution to the problems at hand.

If you want to work on [an already existing issue](https://github.com/Errorname/prisma-multi-tenant/issues), **add a comment saying you are working on it**. Otherwise, there may be multiple people working on the same issue.

If you want to work on something else, please **create an issue explaining what you want to do**. People will then be able to give you some ideas or context to help you.

> Note: Want to contribute but don't know where to start? Send me a message on [Prisma's Slack](https://slack.prisma.io/) (@Errorname)!

## 2. Cloning and bootstrapping Prisma-multi-tenant

Once you have an issue, you can clone and bootstrap Prisma-multi-tenant:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Errorname/prisma-multi-tenant.git
npm run bootstrap # There may be a few warnings/errors
```

## 3. Running Prisma-multi-tenant

Prisma-multi-tenant is a mono-repository hosting multiple packages:

Main packages:

- `prisma-multi-tenant` found in `/packages/cli`
- `@prisma-multi-tenant/client` found in `/packages/client`
- `@prisma-multi-tenant/shared` found in `/packages/shared`

Integrations packages:

- `@prisma-multi-tenant/blitz` found in `/packages/blitz`
- `@prisma-multi-tenant/redwood` found in `/packages/redwood`

Those packages are written in Typescript. For each one of those package, you will need to build it with the following command:

```sh
cd packages/shared
npm run build -- -w

cd packages/cli
npm run build -- -w

cd packages/client
npm run build -- -w

# etc...
```

Now, whenever you use the command `prisma-multi-tenant` or `pmt`, it will use your local version.

> Note: PMT uses npm workspaces, available from npm@7+. Make sure your npm version is up-to-date

You can now work on your issue! ðŸ¥³

Your contribution is working beyond expectation? Great, let's add it to the project!

But first, let's make sure your code is correctly formatted, and doesn't introduce regressions:

# At the root of prisma-multi-tenant
npm run check
```

Everything's green? Perfect!
