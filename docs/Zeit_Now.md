# Issues with Zeit Now

If you try to deploy and use Prisma-multi-tenant on Zeit Now, you may encounter the following problems:

## Cannot find Query Engine / Migration Engine

**Error:**

When trying to programmatically create a new tenant, you may receive the following error:

```
"Command failed: \"/var/task/node_modules/prisma2/build/index.js\" migrate up --create-db --experimental\nError: Could not find query-engine binary. Searched in /var/task/node_modules/prisma2/query-engine-rhel-openssl-1.0.x and /var/task/node_modules/query-engine-rhel-openssl-1.0.x\n"
```

This is because Zeit Now did not bundle the query/migration engines in your app.

**Solution:**

In one of your JS file, add the following lines to tell Now to bundle the engines with your app:

```js
import path from 'path'

path.join(__dirname, '../node_modules/prisma2/migration-engine-rhel-openssl-1.0.x')
path.join(__dirname, '../node_modules/prisma2/query-engine-rhel-openssl-1.0.x')
```

> You need to adapt the relative path based on where you JS file is.

## No such file or directory

**Error:**

When trying to programmatically create a new tenant, you may receive the following error:

```
"Command failed: \"/var/task/node_modules/prisma2/build/index.js\" migrate up --create-db --experimental\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir\n"
```

This is because Zeit Now did not bundle the `prisma/` folder in your app.

**Solution:**

In one of your JS file, add the following lines to tell Now to bundle the `prisma/` folder with your app:

```js
import path from 'path'

path.join(__dirname, './prisma/')
```

> You need to adapt the relative path based on where you JS file is.

## Task timed out after 10.01 seconds

**Error:**

When trying to programmatically create a new tenant, you may receive the following error:

```
502 Bad Gateway
Task timed out after 10.01 seconds
```

**Solution:**

Currently, we haven't found a solution for this issue yet, however, it seems that the migration was successfuly done, except for the "Migration" table.
